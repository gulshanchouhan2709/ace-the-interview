Agile Methology

Our Agile team consisted of "Product owner", "Scrum Master" & "Development Team"

Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, we held a planning meeting where the Product Owner presented the prioritized backlog items. The team discussed and selected items for the sprint, breaking them down into manageable tasks.

Daily Standups: Every morning, we had a 15-minute standup meeting where each team member answered three questions: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any impediments?

Task Board: We used Jira to track our tasks, with columns for To Do, In Progress, and Done. This gave us a clear visual representation of our progress.

Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, we held a review meeting where we demonstrated the working product increment to the stakeholders and gathered feedback.

Sprint Retrospective: Finally, we had a retrospective meeting where we discussed what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how we could improve our processes for the next sprint."
