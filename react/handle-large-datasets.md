# Handle Large Datasets

Handling large datasets effectively in React applications is crucial for performance and user experience.

**Data Chunking, Pagination, Virtualization:**

**Chunking:** Instead of loading the entire dataset at once, break it down into smaller chunks for rendering. We can use slice method or library like react-window can help with chunking.

**Pagination:** Implement pagination to allow users to navigate through the data in manageable pages.

**Virtualization:** Virtualization techniques beneficial for long lists or grids. Libraries like react-virtualized, react-window, or react-infinite excel in virtualization.
